# Crestron-Helpers

Random small helper modules that I have written along the way

## Notes

- These were generally made on the fly to solve a specific problem. I tried to keep them generic, but I haven't tested beyond what I needed at the time.
- Over time I may clean them up, add examples, etc (but no guarantees; especially if I don't reuse them much myself)
- Yes, the coding is probably pretty rubbish, but hopefully it at least helps provide some ideas...
